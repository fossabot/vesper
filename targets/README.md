@todo - factor it out into separate repo

# vesper-targets

These are [target
specifications](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0131-target-specification.md)
suitable for cross-compiling Rust crates for Vesper. Set your `RUST_TARGET_PATH` to point to this directory.

These are very much based on Robigalia's [sel4-targets]().

## Status

Complete for x86. Untested for ARM.
