          At the time of writing, the VC FW requires a non-default option in
          config.txt to request the ARM CPU boot in 64-bit mode:
          arm_control=0x200

          The VC FW typically provides ARM "stub" code to set up the CPU and
          quiesce secondary SMP CPUs. This is not currently true in 64-bit
          mode. In order to boot U-Boot before the VC FW is enhanced, please
          see the commit description for the commit which added RPi3 support
          for a workaround. Since the instructions are temporary, they are not
          duplicated here. The VC FW enhancement is tracked in
          https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/579.
